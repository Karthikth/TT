LRUCache Implementation Details:
                                
 LRUCache Implementation File: LRUCache.cpp

 This file contains LRUCache class as well as the underlying implementations.

 The implementation adheres to the LRU cache constaints as follows:
   1. LRUCache(int capacity):
          Initializes the LRU cache with positive size capacity.
   2. int get(int key):
          Returns the value of the key if the key exists, otherwise returns -1.
   3. void put(int key, int value):
          Updates the value of the key if the key exists. Otherwise, adds the 
      key-value pair to the cache. If the number of keys exceeds the capacity
      from this operation, evicts the least recently used key from the cache.

 Exception Safety:
   1. LRUCache(int capacity): When initialised with negative size, it throws
      exception of type InvalidCapacity that is derived from std::exception
   2. int get(int key): Doesn't throw
   3. void put(int key, int value): May throw a bad_alloc, but, leaves the 
      underlying data structures in the previous stable state.
 
 Thread-Safety: Not added. Can be incorporated easily as and when needed.
 
 Usage:
    1. This code can be run from any online C++ compiler or by generating a
       binary output file by using a stand-alone compiler
    2. If the implementation of LRUCache is to be linked with other, just
       comment out the main function at the end of the file and go ahead
 
 Refactoring:
       This file can be refactored into multiple header and implementation
 files by providing a makefile to build the binary as needed. Need local setup
 
 Input: It takes an optional input for the capacity, defaulting to 2 otherwise
 
 Output when run as such:
    It will outpt the results of the set of pre-defined test cases as written
 in the TEST_* functions at the bottom of the file, just above the main.
 They can be tweaked to add/remove more cases and the needed TEST_* functions
 can be commented/uncommented in the run_and_test_lru_cache_impl() function
 just above the main function at the bottom.
